# Assessment solution

This repository contains my solution to the Assessment 2019 for the module Fundamentals of Data Analysis at GMIT.
[See here for the instructions](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/project-2019-fundda/raw/master/project.pdf)

## My investigation into the tips dataset

I created a Jupyter notebook, where I investigated the tips dataset using the seaborn package in Python. The project is broken into three parts, as follows:

*  **Description**: I described the tips dataset by using the descriptive statistics and plots.

* **Regression**: I investigated whether there is a relationship between the total bill and tip amount.

* **Analyse**: I analysed the relationship between the
variables within the dataset.
