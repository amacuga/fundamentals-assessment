    "This assessment concerns the well-known tips dataset and the Python packages seaborn and jupyter. The project is broken into three parts, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Description**: Create a git repository and make it available online for the lecturer to clone. The repository should contain all your work for this assessment. Within the repository, create a jupyter notebook that uses descriptive statistics and plots to describe the tips dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Regression**: To the above jupyter notebook add a section that discusses and analyses whether there is a relationship between the total bill and tip amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Analyse**: Again using the same notebook, analyse the relationship between the variables within the dataset. You are free to interpret this as you wish â€” for example, you may analyse all pairs of variables, or select a subset and analyse those."
